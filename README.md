# Self-Driving Car Segmentation ðŸš—ðŸ§ 

Segmentation of road scenes is a core task in autonomous driving and computer vision. In this project, I develop and explore segmentation models on a driving dataset (e.g. GTA driving scenes) to identify classes like road, cars, pedestrians, buildings, etc.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This repository contains:
- A dataset of driving scenes (GTA / synthetic / real world)  
- Jupyter notebooks exploring segmentation techniques  
- Implementation of segmentation models  
- Visualizations and evaluation of segmentation performance

The goal: take input driving images and output pixel-level segmentation masks that label different classes (road, vehicles, pedestrians, background, etc.).

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python**  
- Deep learning / segmentation frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras)  
- Image processing & visualization: OpenCV, PIL, matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebooks for experiments and visualization  
- Data handling: NumPy, Pandas  
- Evaluation metrics: IoU (Intersection over Union), pixel accuracy, etc.
